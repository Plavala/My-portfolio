# CBHW-W2-Oscar-Portfolio
Oscar Salgado's Coding Portfolio

## Description
For our 2nd week homework we were asked to create a web application. We were tasked to Build a portfolio page for us!

*Here is an example of what that page looks like.*

![*This page includes a navigation bar, a header image, and info box's such as about me and past examples*](./Assets/Images/example.png)

In this homework I took inspiration from my last homework "CodeRefactor '' and built on top of that to create my Portfolio. I integrated all necessary changes and added all requested information. changed up the back layout and margins so it can be visible and adjusted through various types of screens. The page contains a section about me, how to contact me, previous home work examples and a link to my github for more of my work. all links on site work and all info is up to date. I will continue to update the page as my progress continues. the repo was not working but turns out it was due to spelling error so all should be working now.

List of acceptance criteria:
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio,
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation,
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work,
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application,
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications,
THEN I am taken to that deployed application.
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices,
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
